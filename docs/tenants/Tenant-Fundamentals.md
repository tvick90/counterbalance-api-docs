# Tenant Fundamentals


## What is a Tenant Account

A **Tenant** is an individual Counterbalance platform account. 

A new tenant is created when an organization or individual creates a relationship with Counterbalance through the account signup process or by having an account created on their behalf.

Each tenant account is assigned a unique **Tenant ID**.

## Account Confirmation

Every new tenant must be confirmed before it can be used. During account creation, a six-digit code is emailed to the new user. This code must be entered by the user who created the account via the Confirm a Tenant Account endpoint.
